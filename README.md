# Automated the redundancy of reptile caregiving by using a Raspberry-Pi to read temp/humidity of environment and power on/off a heat-lamp and humidifier.
â€¢	Used Node.js to read sensor and store readings in a remote Google Firestore database. This information will be displayed to the user in a mobile app and allow the user to set desired temp/humidity, manually control the devices power state, and view a livestream of the environment.
